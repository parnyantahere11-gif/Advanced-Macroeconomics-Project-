# Parnian – Advanced Macroeconomics Project

This repository contains my university project for Advanced Macroeconomics.  
It includes MATLAB and Dynare model files, figures, and LaTeX documentation for three sets of exercises:

- **Set 1–3**: Model simulations and impulse response analysis  
- **.mod files** – Dynare models  
- **.m files** – MATLAB scripts  
- **.png files** – Generated figures  
- **.pdf / .tex** – Project report and supporting documents

Developed as part of my master’s coursework at Martin-Luther University Halle-Wittenberg.
